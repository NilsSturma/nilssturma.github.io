I am a mathematical statistician working at TU Munich in the group of Mathias Drton, where I also completed my PhD in September 2024. My research focuses on various aspects of graphical models. The models have a wide range of applications, for example, in the context of causal inference. Among other things, the aim is to investigate under which circumstances observational data allows conclusions about causal relationships. To tackle problems in statistics, I particularly like to use methods from algebraic geometry.

I visited MIT and Broad Institute during fall semester 2022, where I worked with Caroline Uhler.
