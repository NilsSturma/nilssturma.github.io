I am a PhD Student working at TU Munich in the Mathematical Statistics group, where I am supervised by Mathias Drton. My current research focuses on various aspects of graphical models, which have manifold applications in the context of causal discovery. Among other things, the aim is to investigate under which circumstances observational data allow conclusions about causal relationships. To tackle problems in statistics, I particularly like to use methods from algebraic geometry.
