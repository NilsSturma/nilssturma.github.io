I am a PhD Student working at TU Munich in the Mathematical Statistics group, where I am supervised by Mathias Drton. My current research focuses on various aspects of graphical models that capture causal relationships in a collection of random variables. This includes. among others, investigating under which circumstances observational data allow conclusions about causal relationships or developing valid statistical tests in the context of model selection. To tackle problems in statistics, I particularly like to use methods from algebraic geometry.
